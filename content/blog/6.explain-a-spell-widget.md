Ever wished you could cast a spell and unveil its secrets? In this tutorial, we're conjuring up a dynamic form within a Service Portal widget that does just that. Our mission: type a spell, hit "Explain," and voilà - its meaning is revealed! While this sounds like magic, it's all about smart coding. We'll focus on a simplified widget version to grasp the basics.

**What You'll Learn**

- Crafting a form using Bootstrap
- Setting up a read-only input field
- Implementing and managing button events
- Binding input values
- Exchanging data between client and server

### Step 1: Creating a Bootstrap-Styled Form with JSON Demo Data

We begin by constructing a form styled with Bootstrap. The form has two inputs: "Requested For," which will be pre-filled and read-only, representing the current user, and a "Spell" input for the user's query. We use JSON to mock-up initial data for these fields:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "form": {
            "requested_for": "Hermione Granger",
            "spell": ""
        }
    }
}
```

```html
<div>
  <h2>Request A Spell Explanation</h2>
  <div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="requested_for">Requested For</label>
      <input 
             readonly
             type="text" 
             class="form-control" 
             id="requested_for" 
             value={{c.data.form.requested_for}}>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="spell">Spell</label>
      <input 
             type="text" 
             class="form-control" 
             id="spell" 
             value={{c.data.form.spell}}>
    </div>
    <button class="btn btn-success">Explain</button>
  </div>
 
</div>
```

The `value={{c.data.form.requested_for}}` and `value={{c.data.form.spell}}` are supposed to be retrieved from the widget's server script (but right now we get it from the JSON demo data).

The **`readonly`** attribute on the first input prevents modification, ensuring it only displays data.

### Step 2: Bring your JSON Demo Data to the Widget Server Script

Next, we aim to fetch initial data directly from the server instead of relying on JSON.This involves modifying the global **`data`** object:

```jsx
// Widget Server Script
data.form = {
    "requested_for": "Hermione Granger",
    "spell": ""
};
```

Now you can delete the JSON demo data and the result remains the same, as the data will now be fetched from the server.

### Step 3: Enabling Interaction with the Form

Our form now looks good now, but basically we are not able to interact with it. In order to do that, we will add an event listener to the "Explain" button and handle the logic with a function in the client script. In Service Portal widgets, we use AngularJS syntax **`ng-click`** instead of the standard HTML **`onclick`**:

```html
<button ng-click="c.explain()" class="btn btn-success">Explain</button>
```

```jsx
// Widget Client Script
c.explain = function () {
    console.log('You clicked the Explain button');     
}
```

This code captures the button click event and logs something out for testing, setting the stage for further processing.

### Step 4: Binding the Input Field to Data

To access the input value, you typically use the **`ng-model`** directive to bind the input field to a property in the widget's client controller. Simply replace `value={{c.data.form.spell}}` with `ng-model="c.data.form.spell"`

```html
<input 
     type="text" 
     class="form-control" 
     id="spell" 
     ng-model="c.data.form.spell">
```

In the widget’s client controller, **`c`** is the common alias for **`this`** in the client controller. We can try to test if we successfully access the value of the input field through the global object `data`

```jsx
// Widget Client Script
c.explain = function () {
    console.log('You clicked the Explain button');
    console.log('The spell is: ' + c.data.form.spell);
}
```

### Step 5: Send Input Data to the Server

What we want to do is everytime the user click “Explain” button, we will tell the server to run some logic to process whatever spell the user just put in. This can be done in the client controller via Client script global functions`this.server.get([Object])`. It will send the `Object` to the server, the server will access this via `input`

```jsx
// Widget Client Script
c.explain = function () {
    c.server.get(c.data.form);
}
```

If you do not remember what `c.data.form` is, look back in step 2. We are sending an object that holds the value of all the inputs of the form

```
c.data.form = {
    "requested_for": "Hermione Granger",  
    "spell": <Whatever spell the user types in>
}
```

In your server script, you can access this data using **`input`**:

```jsx
// Widget Server Script
if (input) {
    gs.info('Widget Server Script: ' + input.spell);
}
```
By checking if `input` has value, we will ensure that the code under it will only run when the client sends something, it will not be executed when the form is loaded.

### Step 6: Do some logic under the server then push back the result to the client

Since we do not have a fancy database, our server now only learns the spell “Lumos”, we will train them better in the future.

```jsx
// Widget Server Script
if (input) {
    var inputSpell = input.spell;
    if (inputSpell === "lumos") {
        data.form.spell = inputSpell + ": means to turn on the light";
    } else {
        data.form.spell = inputSpell + ": Sorry I do not know this";
    }
}
```

This server script is supposed to override the input value on the form with the original input + the meaning it found (or not). Let’s log it out to see how it looks like. Remember that `this.server.get([Object])` return a Promise, so we need to handle the response in a callback function.

```jsx
// Widget Client Script
c.server.get(c.data.form).then(function(response) {
    console.log(response);
});
```
![spell-form.gif](/img/20240101_1.png)

We can see now the response contains an updated value of the data. But you will not see any changes on the form yet. The value of the input is bound to `c.data.form.spell`, so the last step is to assign the response value to it. We do not really care much about the requested for field because it’s readonly already.

```jsx
c.server.get(c.data.form).then(function(response) {
    c.data.form.spell = response.data.form.spell;
});
```

### Step 7: Validation

Remember to always validate and sanitize user inputs both client-side and server-side to ensure security and integrity of the data. For example only send the input to the server if user actually put something in, convert the spell to lowercase before comparing to avoid case-sensitive etc...

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can create a dynamic form within a Service Portal widget that interacts with the server and displays responses. This basic framework is adaptable for more complex applications, highlighting the potential of Service Portal widgets in enhancing user experience. Here is the full code:

```html
<div>
    <h2>Request A Spell Explanation</h2>
    <div>
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="requested_for">Requested For</label>
            <input
                    readonly
                    type="text"
                    class="form-control"
                    id="requested_for"
                    value={{c.data.form.requested_for}}>
        </div>
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="spell">Spell</label>
            <input
                    type="text"
                    class="form-control"
                    id="spell"
                    ng-model="c.data.form.spell">
        </div>
        <button ng-click="c.explain()" class="btn btn-success">Explain</button>
    </div>
</div>
```
```javascript
// Widget Client Script
function() {
    var c = this;
    c.explain = function () {
        c.server.get(c.data.form).then(function(response) {
            c.data.form.spell = response.data.form.spell;
        });
    }
}
```
```jsx
// Widget Server Script
(function() {

    data.form = {
        "requested_for": "Hermione Granger",
        "spell": ""
    };

    if (input) {
        var inputSpell = input.spell;
        if (inputSpell === "lumos") {
            data.form.spell = inputSpell + ": Means to turn on the light";
        } else {
            data.form.spell = inputSpell + ": Sorry I do not know this";
        }
    }

})();
```
