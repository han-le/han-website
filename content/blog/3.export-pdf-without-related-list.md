### The issue

I remember one time I got an interesting requirement, it was not particularly challenging, but it was definitely something I hadn't anticipated.

The general functionality in ServiceNow allows users to export a record to PDF, which conveniently includes its related list. This feature is especially handy for providing comprehensive data in one export.

However, a challenge arose when some members of the Service Desk team pointed out an inefficiency. The incident form has a tab in the related list showcasing "Incidents from the same caller," which aims to offer deeper insights into the history of the requester. When certain users had a long history of incident submissions, exporting the main incident to PDF would also generate a file with pages and pages, which is not necessary.

The immediate solution that sprang to my mind was to disable the automatic export of the related list. But, this would be a blanket solution affecting all forms, inadvertently disrupting users across various departments. I needed a better way.

### How to export PDF without related list?

If ServiceNow exports everything visible on the page, the logical step would be to hide what isnâ€™t required in the export. The solution? Craft a new view that omits all related lists and label it intuitively. When users select this view and proceed with the export, they're rewarded with a clean, got-to-the-point PDF to help them focus solely on the primary information.

While there might be more sophisticated solutions out there, this approach was efficient, straightforward, and perfectly aligned with the client's needs. Sometimes, the simplest solutions can be the most effective.

### Creating a view for a form in ServiceNow

Right-click the header and select Configure > Form Layout.

Form view and section > View name > New
Remember that this name should be unique and cannot use special characters or spaces, only the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and _.

Continue to build your form view. Choose the fields you want to display in this view by either adding or subtracting them from the "Selected" column. To alter their sequence on the form, simply shift the fields up or down.
