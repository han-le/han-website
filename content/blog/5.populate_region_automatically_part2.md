The requirement of our task is mentioned in [the previous part](https://han.codebynetwork.com/blog/populate_region_automatically_part1).

### The logic
So, we want the system to populate the region of the **user** whenever there's a **change** in the location, whether it's due to a new user registration **(insert)** or an update to an existing user's location **(update)**.

### Add a business rule

Based on the logic, our business rule will run against table user. Open this table and create a new business rule.

**When to run**
- When: before
- Check: Insert, Update
- Filter condition: `Locatation` + `changes`

### Script

1. Get the location of the current user, then get the country of that location, this will return a string: `current.location.country`

2. Search for that country in the country table

    ```javascript  
    var countryObj = new GlideRecord('core_country');
    countryObj.addQuery('name', current.location.country);
    countryObj.query();
    ```
3. If we find a match, get the region of the country and assign it back to the region of the user: `current.u_region = countryObj.u_region;`

The full script
```javascript  
(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {
    var countryObj = new GlideRecord('core_country');
    countryObj.addQuery('name', current.location.country); 
    countryObj.query();    
    if (countryObj.next()) {
        current.u_region = countryObj.u_region;    
    }
})(current, previous);
```
