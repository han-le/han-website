### What is a Record Producer and why we need them?

A manager wants to create 2 groups on ServiceNow to assign separate tasks to the group members. Instead of reaching out to the admin each time, they prefer to handle this independently. In this article, we'll set up a form accessible via the service portal for managers. 
After they submit the form, a new group will be created in the Group table. The manager now can add their members to the group and assign tasks to them. This specific form is called a `record producer`.
We can even go further by introducing validation logic or by integrating a workflow for reviews by HR or senior management.

### How to create a Record Producer?
1. In the filter navigator, go to Service Catalog > Catalog Definitions > Record Producers
2. Create `New` and provide the information of this record produce
- Name: The name of the form
- Table: The most important, in this case we will choose table "Group" [sys_user_group] because we want a new group to be created after the manager submits the form.
- Accessibility: `Service Catalog`
- Category: If you want users to be able to search for this Item, add it to a Category
3. Save / Submit
4. On the record producer Related List, under Variables, you need to create question to ask the user, this will match with the field of the table.

### Another the way which I prefer

1. In the filter navigator, go to System Definitions > Tables. Or open table[sys_db_object]
2. Open the table you want to create the record producer. In this case it's `Group` - table [sys_user_group]
3. Go the Related Links, choose `Add to Service Catalog`
4. In this page, we will build the Record Producer.
- Name your record producer: Input information
- Short description: Input information
- Category: Input information
  -> Now under the bucket list, we will choose the fields you want to display on the record producer. The user will only see those fields on the form. For example, I want the manager to provide name, manager, email, members of the group they want to create.
5. Save and Open -> Now you fill in the accessibility and category.

### Test your work

You can click on "Try it" to test the record producer. You can also go to the Service Portal and search for it based on the name.

After submitting the record producer, we will have a new group:
