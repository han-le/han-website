### The requirement

Within our organization, employees are categorized by the following regions: Asia, Europe, North America, Africa, and South America. I aim to replicate this structure in ServiceNow, enabling the ServiceDesk to efficiently direct incidents to the appropriate regional team. This setup will also allow me to generate reports on employee distribution across regions.

### The approach

Out of the box, each user has two attributes: "company" and "location." Either can be used to determine the user's country, but for the purposes of this guide, I'll focus on "location." However, the "region" option is missing. To address this, I'll create a new field in both the "user" and "country" tables to capture the region. I'll then implement a business rule: whenever a user record is created or updated with a new location, the system will identify the related country, retrieve its region, and update the user's profile accordingly. This automation eliminates the need for admins to manually assign regions. To avoid discrepancies between "location" and "region" due to human error, I suggest making the "region" field read-only, ensuring it's updated exclusively by the system.

In summary, here are 3 steps we will do:
1. Add new field to `Country` table: region -> Choice
2. Add new field to `User` table: region -> Choice (the choice will be a reference to those choices of the region field in table country). Make it read only.
3. Create a business rule to populate the region of the user

### Create a new field for a table

Firstly, we will add a dropdown field called "Region" to table `Country`, with the options as mentioned in the requirement.

1. Open the table Country: In the Application Navigator, type `core_country.LIST`
2. Open Table Configuration: Right click to the column header > Configure > Table

3. Add New Field:
- Scroll down to tab "Column" that has a list of fields, look at the bottom, you will see the last empty row "Insert a new row". Double click and fill out the information then save
  - Column label: Region
  - Type: Choice

- Open the newly created field, go its related list, under "Choices", add the options: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America.

### Make a list of choices points to a different list

Now we are going to repeat the same thing with table `User`. In order to make sure that all the region options in `User` match with `Country`, it is possible in ServiceNow to create a reference, here how we do it.

- Create the field as usual.
- After the creation, open the field, go to "Related Links" choose "Advanced view"
- The form will be reloaded.
- In the advanced view, look at the tab "Choice List Specification" and choose:
  - Choice table: Country [core_country]
  - Choice field: Region
=> Now if you update the choices in table Country, it will reflect the same on table User

In the [next post](https://han.codebynetwork.com/blog/populate_region_automatically_part2), we will configure the form so our new field will appear there. See ya.
