Within the ServiceNow ecosystem, think of an "update set batch" as a master container, encompassing multiple individual update sets. An update set batch is a parent of several update sets. We group them together and move to another instance in one go.

Picture the following scenario: For an next release, your client has outlined the addition to add three new features, coupled with some crucial bug fixes. Tasks are delegated across your team. As each member completes their assignments and the changes pass testing and validation, their respective update sets are added into the main update set batch. Come release day, the deployment team carefully reviews and commits the entire update set batch. In a flash, the collaborative efforts of your team go live.

Here's a brief step-by-step on leveraging update set batches:
1. Establish a new Update Set Batch: Initiate by creating a new update set, this will be your batch
2. Add individual Update Sets to the batch Add the update set to the batch by setting the parent value as the batch.

3. Preview and commit the batch as how you do with a normal update set. If you open the update set batch you will see all the child update sets in the related list.
